Title: Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Code

Purpose: Analyze historical stock market data to identify trends and predict future stock prices using two models: ARIMA and LSTM.

Key Components:

Data Fetching:

Library: yfinance Input: Stock ticker and period Output: Historical stock data Data Preparation:

Libraries: pandas, numpy Steps: Dataframe conversion, target variable creation, training/testing set split (80% for training) Outputs: Prepared datasets for ARIMA and LSTM models Prediction Models:

A. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Library: statsmodels Configuration: Predefined order (5,1,0); ideally, use auto.arima for optimal order selection B. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Libraries: keras, tensorflow Configuration: 2-layer LSTM with Dropout; simplified for demonstration Evaluation and Visualization:

Metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both models Visualization: Simplified plot comparing actual prices with ARIMA and LSTM predictions Inputs and Customizations:

Ticker Symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc.) Data Period (e.g., "1y" for 1 year) ARIMA Order (ideally, automate selection for better fit) LSTM Architecture (can be modified for more layers, units, etc.) Output:

MSE Values for ARIMA and LSTM models Visual Comparison of actual stock prices vs. predicted values for both models
